# CART253 - Creative Computation I, Exercise 1: I like to move it!

Instructions:
- Background color is dependent on mouseY position (when above the clouds the sky clears up and below the clouds the sky is grey)
- Rain amount is dependent on mouseX position (to the left is less rain, to the right is more rain)
- Raindrop and puddle transparency is dependent on mouseY position (higher is more transparent)
