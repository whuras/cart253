# CART253 - Creative Computation I, Project 1: Simulation!
## Wayne Huras, ID 40074423

Instructions:
On the title screen, enter 1-6 to simulate the survival of 1-6 types of creatures.

Creatures start with a power level of 1, and when they "eat" another creature
they add their power to their own and increase in size.

There is a 50% chance of reproduction every reproduction cycle. Offspring
inherit the parent's power, speed, and reproduction time with a random offset.

The reproduction cycle time and creature movement speed can be altered by the
player with the arrow keys at any time.
