# CART253 - Creative Computation I, Project 2: Anything
## Wayne Huras, ID 40074423

Instructions:
1. Open the program and click on the start button to begin.
2. Click on the lowest-most circle to grow a vine which follows your cursor.
3. Connect the end of the vine to another circle by clicking on it.
  3.1. Each circle has a note which will play in harmony with the previous 2
  notes you connected.
4. Grow additional vines from the nodes of previous ones.
5. Repeat to grow a gnarly tree singing the connected music notes.

Artist's Statement:
This is a 2D interactive piece focused on meditation and growth. It beings with
a relatively blank screen with a few circles and some background music. To start
the interaction, the player must click on the bottom-most circle, growing a vine
from the circle as if it were a seed. From that seed grows not only a vine, but 
also a colorful mandala which is a geometric configuration often used in Eastern
religions to bring focus, spiritual guidance, and aid in meditation and trance
induction. In addition to the mandala, the seed also begins to emit a tone which
can be previewed by the user via hovering over the circles. The user can grow
many vines, each stemming from previous ones to connect other circles and
therefore other tones. The program continues to emit the three most recent tones
to create a triad. Through experimentation (growth) the user can create harmonic
 or clashing triads.
